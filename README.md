This repository demonstrates a common error in Swift's async/await error handling.  The `fetchData()` function uses `try await` to fetch data from a URL. However, if `fetchData` throws a non-standard error, the `catch` block might not handle it correctly. The solution shows how to improve error handling by either ensuring that all thrown errors conform to the `Error` protocol or using more specific error handling techniques.
